<h1 align="center">GraphQL Book Search Refactor</h1>
  

## Description

  This is a code refactor of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine originally built with a RESTful API, which I converted into a GraphQL API built using Apollo Server. It is a full-stack MERN app, meaning it uses MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It also uses React Bootstrap for components and styling.

## Installation

  1. Download the repository.
  2. Run `npm i` or `npm install` on the directory.
  3. Run `npm run develop` on the same directory to have both server and client running at the same time.

Here's a gif demonstrating the functionality:

## Purpose

  Often times junior-level programmers are tasked with taking an existing, perfectly working app and have to make it do the same thing but more efficiently. This was solid practice for doing just that, and practice like this gives me a good idea where to start in future projects like this.

## Contributing
  
  All changes to the starter code were done by me, feel free to look through and see if there was anything I missed, or an outdated package!
